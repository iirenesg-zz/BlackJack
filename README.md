## Design Patterns practice. Team project. 
We designed and developed a blackjack game with basic functionality (hit card, stand, make bets).
The whole game was done using the MVC design pattern, we also used the Observer Pattern to connect the Model and View parts, the Singleton pattern to keep the stats of the game, the Constructor pattern for the Card objects and the Command pattern for the dealer functionality.
